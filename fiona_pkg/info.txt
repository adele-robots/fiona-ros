- To run ROS on multiple machines, all of them must be in the same local network.
  While working on multiple machines, you need only one roscore running. Choose one device for it- we will call it master.
  
	> On the master device open the .bashrc file and write:
		export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://X.X.X.X:11311
		export ROS_IP=Y.Y.Y.Y
    	replacing X.X.X.X and Y.Y.Y.Y with IP address of master device.

  	> On second device also open the .bashrc file. This time replace X.X.X.X with IP address of master device and Y.Y.Y.Y with IP address of second        device.
